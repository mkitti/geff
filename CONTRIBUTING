# CONTRIBUTING

We recommend using `pixi` for environment management while developing `geff`.
See the [pixi docs](https://pixi.sh/dev/) for installation instructions. The
following instructions will be focused on pixi-based development, but all of the
same tasks can be completed with pip and another environment manager.

For local development, clone the repo and install in editable mode.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/funkelab/geff.git
pixi install
```

## Testing

To run tests

```sh
pixi run test
```

## Style

We utilize `pre-commit` with ruff for linting and formatting. If you would like to run `pre-commit` locally:

```sh
pixi run pre-commit run -a
```

To always run `pre-commit` before committing, you can install the pre-commit hooks by running:

```sh
pixi run pre-commit install
```

Alternatively [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/), will run and commit changes on any open PRs.

## Releases

In order to deploy a new version, tag the commit with a version number and push
it to github. This will trigger a github action that will build and deploy to
PyPI. (see the "deploy" step in workflows/ci.yml). The version number is
determined automatically based on the tag.


```sh
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m v0.1.0
git push --follow-tags
```

## Docs

Docs are written with MkDocs

Relevant commands can be run using `pixi run -e docs <mkdocs command>`

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
